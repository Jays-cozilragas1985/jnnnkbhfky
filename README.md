Wow, okay. I just stumbled out of that theater, still traily with the popcorn scent on my hoodie. Peter Pan's Neverland Nightmare — what a trip, right? Got me all wired up. Like, man, where do I even start? It's like my brain's got Tinker Bell sparkles mixed with pirate patches. Oh, my back’s doing that thing again. Least the seat wasn’t as bad as last time. 

Dude, the theater was so noisy. People munching, chatting, this kid asking about crocodiles ALL THE TIME. But Lost Boys all grown and dark, like they had to fend off zombie pirates or something. Rufio’s new mohawk was actually a little terrifying, lol. And Wendy, ugh, she had this whole I-don’t-give-a-dust-about-fairies thing going. Really intense vibes, like mixing energy drinks with double espressos. 

> Like, Captain Hook's new hand? Bro, it was basically made of nightmares dipped in shadows. Haunted my entire popcorn, seriously. What was up with that ending though? Looping time, blurring colors, felt like a retro VHS glitch, like when the tape gets chewed up. I swear, thought I saw a unicorn doing skater tricks across a rainbow, or did I just imagine that? 

Pan was more like Peter Panned out, if you know what I mean. Kind of strung-out but still flying, rogue angel-style. Made me wanna download the movie just to catch all those weird details slipping by, like sand through my brain-fingers. You gotta watch the movie but, like, brace for the cacophony. It's like your brain’s at a carnival and an 80s horror film snuck in. 

I can't even right now. There was something about the battling clocks in the terror forest — like an Alice in Wonderland but more cursed. And my buddy, that’s where I realized I was crunching old popcorn crumbs as if they were sacred relics or something. That's how zonked it got me.

C# time: 
```csharp
// Random code fragment
int lostBoyShadow = 42;
while(neverland > 0)
{
   dream += pirateChase; 
   if (hookHand == shadowy){
       return sleep.escape();
   }
}
```
